# EDA_PlayStore

**This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Google Play Store dataset to uncover insights into app performance, user engagement, and market trends. I contributed by cleaning and preprocessing the dataâ€”handling missing values, fixing data types, and filtering outliers. Using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, I created visualizations such as pie charts, bar plots, box plots, and correlation heatmaps to identify patterns across app categories, install counts, reviews, and ratings. I also performed category-wise breakdowns and top-5 app analysis across genres like Games, Social, and Productivity. Additionally, I implemented subplot visualizations and incremental install comparisons to understand trends at a deeper level. The insights derived from this analysis can guide developers and businesses in making data-driven decisions for app development and marketing strategies.**
